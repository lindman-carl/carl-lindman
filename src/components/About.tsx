      <p>
        I am a self-taught <b>full stack web developer</b> excited by building{" "}
        <em>complex stateful web apps</em> with <b>React.js</b>, with a love for
        the predictability of <b>TypeScript</b> and the efficiency of{" "}
        <b>TailwindCSS</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ever-evolving environment of web development is exactly what my
        dopamine receptors crave. I grasp concepts quickly and I am always eager
        to learn new technologies and frameworks. I am a passionate problem
        solver and I love building things just to prove my ability to. I believe
        that limiting myself to either front-end or back-end would be limiting
        my creativity, no exciting apps are built with only one of those.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am <b>currently looking</b> for a full time position as a{" "}
        <b>web developer</b>.
