        I am a self-taught <b>full stack developer</b>, currently excited by
        building complex stateful web apps with <b>React</b>. I believe that
        nothing you can&apos;t build with <b>TypeScript</b> is worth building,
        unless you pay me then anything is possible. I soon have the ability to
        put my projects on <b>Azure</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really enjoy using <b>new stuff</b>.
